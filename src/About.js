    <h2>More about FileKeep</h2>
    FileKeep is a web application which users are able to access and share files pertaining to their clients. Users are able to directly download soft copies and input their required information which the program then sends to the companies’ or organizations cloud storage. From the cloud, these companies/organizations are able to access each of their users files directly, with removing the middle man, and most importantly, paper.

    FileKeep’s main goal is to become 100% ecofriendly, and completely eliminate the use of paper. Our web application was specifically designed for clinics, but has the capability for file sharing in banks, police stations, warehouses, etc. Here at FileKeep, we make sure that the product is always complete, and continuously update the internal systems daily.

    FileKeep was designed by three university students in Canada. Shahob Kazemi, who attends Ryerson University for Computer Engineering, Syed Wadood, who attends Ryerson University for Computer Engineering, and Rishi Shah, who attends McMaster University for Kinesiology. FileKeep was designed and integrated during the University of Toronto’s NewHacks 2020, sponsored by IEEE.
